CSS Rounder
============

There are about a 'gazillion' articles on the web about making those cute rounded corner boxes with a variety of techniques.  The consensus seems to favor semantic markup with a minimum of CSS selectors.

One technique I found called "pullquote" () seemed straightforward enough, although like many techniques it requires four images, one for each corner of the shaded area.  Rather than fire up Photoshop every time I wanted a different color or radius I decided to fire up my text editor and make a simple tool for doing this.  Enter will_round.

Usage is super easy, after installing the plugin just run the generator:

     script/plunin generate rounded_div CSS_NAME CORNER_RADIUS SVG_COLOR

EXAMPLE
=======

For example, run the generator:

    script/generate rounded_div some_selector_name 12 peachpuff

This will generate the CSS and image files necessary

Note that rmagick is required.  The color should be specified as a W3C SVG Color Name (see http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#ColorKeywords)
